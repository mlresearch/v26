title: An Unbiased Offline Evaluation of Contextual Bandit Algorithms with Generalized
  Linear Models
abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms have become popular tools in online   recommendation
  and advertising systems. \emphOffline evaluation of the effectiveness of new algorithms
  in these applications is critical for protecting online user experiences but very
  challenging due to their “partial-label” nature.  A common practice is to create
  a simulator which simulates the online environment for the problem at hand and then
  run an algorithm against this simulator. However, creating the simulator itself
  is often difficult and modeling bias is usually unavoidably introduced. The purpose
  of this paper is two-fold.  First, we review a recently proposed \emphoffline evaluation
  technique.  Different from simulator-based approaches, the method is completely
  data-driven, is easy to adapt to different applications, and more importantly, provides
  provably unbiased evaluations.  We argue for the wide use of this technique as standard
  practice when comparing bandit algorithms in real-life problems. Second, as an application
  of this technique, we compare and validate a number of new algorithms based on \emphgeneralized
  linear models.  Experiments using real Yahoo! data suggest substantial improvement
  over algorithms with linear models when the rewards are binary.
