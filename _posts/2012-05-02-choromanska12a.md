title: Online Clustering with Experts
abstract: 'We propose an online clustering algorithm that manages the exploration/exploitation
  tradeoff using an adaptive weighting over batch clustering algorithms. We extend
  algorithms for online supervised learning, with access to expert predictors, to
  the unsupervised learning setting.  Instead of computing prediction errors in order
  to re-weight the experts, the algorithm computes an approximation to the current
  value of the \emph{k}-means objective obtained by each expert. When the experts
  are batch clustering algorithms with   \emph{b}-approximation guarantees with respect
  to the \emph{k}-means   objective (for example, the \emph{k}-means++ or \emph{k}-means
  # algorithms), applied to a sliding window of the data stream, our algorithm achieves
  an approximation guarantee with respect to the \emph{k}-means objective.  The form
  of this online clustering approximation guarantee is novel, and extends  an evaluation
  framework proposed by Dasgupta as an analog to regret.  Our algorithm tracks the
  best clustering algorithm on real and simulated data sets.'
