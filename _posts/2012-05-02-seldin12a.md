title: PAC-Bayes-Bernstein Inequality for Martingales and its Application to Multiarmed
  Bandits
abstract: We develop a new tool for data-dependent analysis of the   exploration-exploitation
  trade-off in learning under limited   feedback. Our tool is based on two main ingredients.
  The first   ingredient is a new concentration inequality that makes it possible   to
  control the concentration of weighted averages of multiple   (possibly uncountably
  many) simultaneously evolving and   interdependent martingales. The second ingredient
  is an application of this inequality to the exploration-exploitation trade-off via
  importance weighted sampling. We apply the new tool to the stochastic multiarmed
  bandit problem, however, the main importance of this paper is the development and
  understanding of the new tool rather than improvement of existing algorithms for
  stochastic multiarmed bandits. In the follow-up work we demonstrate that the new
  tool can improve over state-of-the-art in structurally richer problems, such as
  stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information.
