title: 'ICML Exploration & Exploitation Challenge: Keep it simple!'
abstract: Recommendation has become a key feature in the economy of a lot of   companies
  (online shopping, search engines...). There is a lot of   work going on regarding
  recommender systems and there is still a lot   to do to improve them. Indeed nowadays
  in many companies most of the   job is done by hand. Moreover even when a supposedly
  smart   recommender system is designed, it is hard to evaluate it without   using
  real audience which obviously involves economic issues. The   ICML Exploration &
  Exploitation challenge is an attempt to make   people propose efficient recommendation
  techniques and particularly   focuses on limited computational resources. The challenge
  also   proposes a framework to address the problem of evaluating a   recommendation
  algorithm with real data. We took part in this   challenge and achieved the best
  performances; this paper aims at   reporting on this achievement; we also discuss
  the evaluation   process and propose a better one for future challenges of the   same
  kind.
