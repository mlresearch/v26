title: Exploration and Exploitation with Insufficient Resources
abstract: In physical experimentation, the resources available to discover new knowledge
  are typically extremely small in comparison to the size and dimensionality of the
  parameter spaces that can be searched. Additionally, due to the nature of physical
  experimentation, experimental errors will occur, particularly in biochemical experimentation
  where the reactants may undetectably denature, or reactant contamination could occur
  or equipment failure. These errors mean that not all experimental measurements and
  observations will be accurate or representative of the system being investigated.
  As the validity of observations is not guaranteed, resources must be split between
  exploration to discover new knowledge and exploitation to test the validity of the
  new knowledge. Currently we are investigating the automation of discovery in physical
  experimentation, with the aim of producing a fully autonomous closed-loop robotic
  machine capable of autonomous experimentation. This machine will build and evaluate
  hypotheses, determine experiments to perform and then perform them on an automated
  lab-on-chip experimentation platform for biochemical response characterisation.
  In the present work we examine how the trade-off between exploration and exploitation
  can occur in a situation where the number of experiments that can be performed is
  extremely small and where the observations returned are sometimes erroneous or unrepresentative
  of the behaviour being examined. To manage this trade-off we consider the use of
  a Bayesian notion of surprise, which is used to perform exploration experiments
  whilst observations are unsurprising from the predictions that can be made and exploits
  when observations are surprising as they do not match the predicted response.
